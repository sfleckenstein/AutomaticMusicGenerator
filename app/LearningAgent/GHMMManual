I wrote this looking at the tutorial at ghmm.org, under documentation.


sigma is the alphabet of the language in question. In the case of this example,
it is all of the possible outcomes of a die roll.

efair and eloaded have to have the same number of columns for B to make sense.

pi has to have the same number of columns as you have different states (I
think). In this case, there are two different states and pi has two columns.

The emission matrix (B) has to have the same number of rows as the transmission
matrix.
The emission matrix (B) has to have the same number of rows as there are states.
The emission matrix must have the same number of rows as there are values in
the alphabet.

The transition matrix (A) must be square (duh).
The rows in the transition matrix must sum to 1.
The rows in the emission matrix must sum to 1.
